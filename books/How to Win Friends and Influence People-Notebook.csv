"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 241","","Criticism is futile because it puts a man on the defensive, and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a man’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses his resentment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 334","","Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favour of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 350","","When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 358","","Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 361","","Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.”"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 382","","Lincoln once began a letter by saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or the “desire” or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the “craving” to be appreciated."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 463","","“There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a man as criticisms from his superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a man incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loathe to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 488","","We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees; but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 506","","The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other is universally condemned."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 516","","When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 per cent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other man’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 533","","Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 591","","Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. “If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from his angle as well as from your own.”"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 697","","The world is full of people like that: grabbing, self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young said: “The man who can put himself in the place of other men, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for him.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 700","","If out of reading this book you get just one thing: an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from his angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the milestones of your career."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 752","","William Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature”. Why can’t we use that same psychology in business? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making the other person think it is ours, why not let him cook and stir the idea himself? He will then regard it as his own; he will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it."

Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t, you will forget them quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 812","","Keep a diary in which to record your triumphs in the application of these principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be when you chance upon them some evening years from now!"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 831","","Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs; a cow has to give milk; and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 840","","You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 842","","People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves—morning, noon, and after dinner."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1003","","Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says: “I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1004","","That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1013","","You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1041","","“Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not. “Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there….”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1046","","It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1062","","So, before entering a man’s office, he always pauses for an instant and thinks of the many things he has to be thankful for, works up a great big honest-to-goodness smile, and then enters the room with the smile just vanishing from his face."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1090","","So if you want people to like you, Rule 2 is: SMILE."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1110","","In the beginning it was a very simple one. Whenever he met a new acquaintance, he found out his complete name, the size of his family, the nature of his business, and the colour of his political opinions. He got all these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met that man, even if it was a year later, he was able to slap him on the back, inquire after the wife and kids, and ask him about the hollyhocks in the back-yard. No wonder he developed a following!"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1160","","Most people don’t remember names for the simple reason that they don’t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves ; they are too busy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1187","","Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, chat a few minutes, and can’t even remember his name when we say good-bye. One of the first lessons a politician learns is this : “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1191","","His technique? Simple. If he didn’t hear the name distinctly, he said : “So sorry. I didn’t get the name clearly.” Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say : “How is it spelt?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1193","","During the conversation he took the trouble to repeat the name several times, and tried to associate it in his mind with the man’s features, expression, and general appearance."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1200","","REMEMBER THAT A MAN’S NAME IS TO HIM THE SWEETEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SOUND IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1222","","I had listened intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay to anyone."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1228","","And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and encouraged him to talk."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1334","","The man who talks only of himself, thinks only of himself. And “the man who thinks only of himself”, says Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University, “is hopelessly uneducated.” “He is not educated,” says Dr. Butler, “no matter how instructed he may be.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1337","","So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. As Mr. Charles Northam Lee puts it: “To be interesting, be interested.” Ask questions that the other man will enjoy answering. Encourage him to talk about himself and his accomplishments."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1339","","Remember that the man you are talking to is a hundred times more interested in himself and his wants and his problems than he is in you and your problems. His toothache means more to him than a famine in China that kills a million people. A boil on his neck interests him more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that next time you start a conversation."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1347","","“Whether it was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat,” wrote Gamaliel Bradford, “Roosevelt knew what to say to him.” And how was it done ? The answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1410","","If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to screw something out of the other person in return—if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1412","","Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that glows and sings in your memory long after the incident is passed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1416","","The law is this : Always make the other person feel important. Professor John Dewey, as we have already noted, says that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and Professor William James says : “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1424","","Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world : “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1425","","You want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don’t want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab puts it, “hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise”. All of us want that."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1441","","Little phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you”, “Would you be so kind as to——”, “Won’t you please”, “Would you mind”, “Thank you”—little courtesies like that oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life—and, incidentally, they are the hall-mark of good breeding."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1454","","Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation. Rossetti considered himself important. That is not strange. Almost everyone considers himself important, very important."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1464","","The untarnished truth is that almost every man you meet feels himself superior to you in some way; and a sure way to his heart is to let him realize in some subtle way that you recognize his importance in his little world, and recognize it sincerely."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1466","","Remember what Emerson said : “Every man I meet is in some way my superior; and in that I can learn of him.”"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1619","","Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants being more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1621","","You can’t win an argument. You can’t, because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him ? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1671","","This tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of human frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1678","","Buddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love”, and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument, but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation, and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint."

And if you can’t be sure of being right even 55 per cent of the time, why should you tell the other people they are wrong?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1694","","You can tell a man he is wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words— and if you tell him he is wrong, do you make him want to agree with you? Never ! For you have struck a direct blow at his intelligence, his judgment, his pride, his self-respect. That will make him want to strike back. But it will never make him want to change his mind. You may then hurl at him all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter his opinion, for you have hurt his feelings."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1711","","If a man makes a statement that you think is wrong— yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it better to begin by saying : “Well, now, look ! I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts” ? There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as : “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1718","","He told me of a certain experiment he had conducted, and I asked him what he tried to prove by it. I shall never forget his reply. He said : “A scientist never tries to prove anything. He attempts only to find the facts.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1721","","You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire the other fellow to be just as fair and open and broadminded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1732","","Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy, and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change their minds about their religion or their hair-cut or Communism or Clark Gable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1744","","We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1755","","When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if are we handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness.

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1804","","“When this man insulted me and shook his fist in my face and told me I didn’t know my business, it took all the self-control I could summon up not to argue and try to justify myself. It took a lot of self-control, but it paid. If I had told him he was wrong and started an argument, there would have been a lawsuit, bitter feelings, a financial loss, and the loss of a valuable customer. Yes, I am convinced that it doesn’t pay to tell a man he is wrong.”"
