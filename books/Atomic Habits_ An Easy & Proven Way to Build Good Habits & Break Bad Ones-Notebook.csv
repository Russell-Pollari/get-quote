"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 149","","We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 214","","“the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 238","","It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 242","","if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 251","","Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 269","","Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 274","","Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 320","","When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 345","","Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 347","","Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 361","","Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 374","","In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 387","","When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 389","","The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 398","","Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 466","","The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 468","","The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 482","","when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 491","","There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 499","","Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 503","","Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.*"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 525","","Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 534","","Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 540","","Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 551","","Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 629","","If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 634","","The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 659","","The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 676","","In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 689","","All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 740","","The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 744","","Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 763","","The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 812","","Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 836","","One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 853","","There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 870","","The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 891","","The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 895","","Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 897","","Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 913","","The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 921","","We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 921","","When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 947","","When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 950","","Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 958","","The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Effect."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1009","","The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1013","","The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1015","","The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1033","","People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1036","","Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1064","","You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1103","","Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1130","","Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1144","","Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1145","","Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1171","","Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1175","","It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1204","","Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1207","","Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1286","","We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1312","","It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1334","","We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1382","","Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1407","","whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1444","","One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1447","","Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1491","","When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1550","","A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1559","","Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1579","","A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state."
"Note","Location 1579","","E.g. This would be better if I was stoned"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1587","","To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1693","","Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1743","","The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1772","","Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1783","","Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our time because they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably convenient."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1794","","The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1835","","Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1845","","Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy."
"Note","Location 1845","","TIdyng the room your everytime  n itt"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1891","","Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1923","","The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1947","","Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1952","","By developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the rest will follow."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1962","","Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore.* The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1999","","Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2001","","The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2002","","The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2003","","Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2014","","Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2017","","A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2028","","The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2047","","The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2174","","We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2316","","Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2323","","The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2324","","Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2328","","The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2338","","habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2350","","First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2352","","Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2354","","Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2355","","Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2371","","Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2374","","Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2743","","boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2753","","But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2757","","The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2770","","The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to experience desire."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2786","","When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2937","","Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2954","","Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3003","","Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3007","","Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3008","","However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3018","","Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3024","","Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3027","","We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.” Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This"
